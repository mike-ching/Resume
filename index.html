            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>IT service management leader with over a decade at Telstra, Australia’s largest telecom provider, driving top-tier support for clients like Commonwealth Bank while collaborating with stakeholders such as HP, Accenture, and internal vendors to align IT with business goals and ensure continuity. I’m passionate about making IT operations work for businesses, with a strong understanding of ITIL practices (PMP in progress), ServiceNow, Cisco networking, and front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS). I’m ITIL certified and, for the past 6 years, have run a brand design agency with 16 specialists, working on IT-related projects from Telstra that blended ITSM and strategic design. Now, I’m seeking new opportunities where I can use this hybrid experience to deliver operational excellence and real value in a collaborative environment. Let’s connect if you’re into leadership that gets results!</p>
